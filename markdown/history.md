# History

Note: When talking about a project or set of projects, its important to understand the history behind the project. AWS launched in 2006 and really drove a lot of change into the public cloud infrastructure and what automation could do for infrastructure services. But they weren't the first and only cloud platforms out there. There were already other platforms out there dabbling into cloud services, from online cloud storage to virtual private servers. However each one was unique.

Note: On his first day in office, President Obama signed a memorandum to all federal agencies directing them to break down barriers to transparency, participation and collaboration between the federal government and the people it is to serve.

Note: NASA open sources the Nebula Platform, which was a compute virtualization platform. This was a direct result 120 days after president Obama sent his memorandum on an Open Government Initiative.

Note: On June 4, 2010 Jim Curry from Rackspace emails Chris Kemp (NASA's CTO) attempting to find synergies between Rackspace's cloud files product (which was soon to be open sourced as Swift) and NASA's Nebula project.

Note: On June 19, 2010 OpenStack was officially launched. At launch it included 25+ partners. Some of these partners include Citrix, Zenoss, Limelight, Dell, Puppet Labs, RightScale, and SoftLayer amongst others.

# Austin Release

Note: The first technical release of an integrated project, with a release codename of Austin was released. The big change here was bug fixes and compute logic from the Nebula and Cloud Servers. By this time the number of partners has grown to 35+.

Note: The OpenStack Foundation was established. The key thing this provided was a multi-stakeholder governance model which enabled various parties to have input to not only profit, but to collaborate, innovate, and drive overall change into the project.

Note: With the explosive growth of OpenStack and the expansive interest, many people wanted to contribute additional services. Previously these would sit in incubator projects hoping to one day become an official OpenStack project. In Liberty, they changed this all by allowing more inclusiveness and openness. Allowing projects to be able to provide value to the OpenStack ecosystem many projects which were waiting in the wings were allowed in.
